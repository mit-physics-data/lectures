    "Now, we have been able to scale our simulation so that it can work pretty well on $mathcal{O}(100)$ different planets. However, we would really to make a setup that can capture the dynamics for 1000s of bodies of stars. Something that we could potentially use to model our galaxy? \n",
    "\n",
    "By going to larger and larger numebers of stars, we can start to capture the full dynamics present when we perform large scale astronomical simulations. The problem with going to large and large number of stars is that we know have more and more pairwise computations to compute the force.  Simply put the force on a single body is : \n",

Which means that for $N_{\\rm body}=1000$, we are talking about a computation that is $\\mathcal{O}(10^{6})$ in computations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now an important point that should be made with large scale stellar simulations is the notion of timescale. We we have two masses that are very far apart, the amount of updates that need to happen is much smaller than if we have two masses that are nearby. The point being that stars that all have roughly the velocity the time updates will impact the local dynamics when $r$ is small compared to large $r$. We can then write a time update as : \n",

    "and in practice the velocities are typically very simlar on large scales, so this yields us to the second equation. Now conceptually, we can also think of the length scale as a way to resolve various tiers of resolution in n-body computations. What I mean is that we can imagine instead of computing the individual forces of many stars that are far away, we can average the mass and the distances and following Gauss's law treat these as a single particle with a combined mass given by the sum of the stars. \n",

This tree will take an image, subdivide into two subimages, then take each sub image and subdivide it and so on. Lets take a look at how it looks. \n",
