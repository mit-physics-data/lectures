# Mit Data Science and Physics 

This github contains the lecture materiasl for the data science and physics class. 

The topics of each week's lectures are described in the syllabus on Canvas. Lectures are in directories labeled by lecture number. Additional data relevant to the lecture is availble from the lecture materials. Problem sets are on canvas, and on a separate github given by https://github.com/mit-physics-data/psets/ . 

Grading and problem sets are due on canvas. Solutions to the problem sets will be availble instantaneously. 

You should also review in-class notebooks and homework solutions to make sure you understand what is happening. The lecture notebooks have in-class exercises, not all will be covered in class. 

Projects are availble on github at : 
https://github.com/mit-physics-data/projrects/

They will be posted in a timely manner before they are due.
